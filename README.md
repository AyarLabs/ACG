# ACG
Arbitrary Cell Generator is a plugin to Berkeley Analog Generator 2.0 (BAG) that enables parametrized
grid-free layout creation. Documentation can be found at <https://acg.readthedocs.io>. The main goal of ACG is
to make it easy to create highly customized layout generators that may not be possible in BAG due to its
requirement to make algorithms technology agnostic. In addition, we make it easy to combine legacy hand-drawn
layouts and IP together with new layout generators.

NOTE: ACG is currently in development, and is being slowly cleaned up for open-source consumption, use at your own risk!
